## What are people saying about International Congress for Conservation Biology 2017 on Twitter?

Here's a brief analysis of tweets from the [International Congress for Conservation Biology](http://conbio.org/mini-sites/iccb-2017) to date. The conference started on the starting 23rd July I was curious to see what people are talking about there and who is doing the talking on twitter.

As of 25th July I could access 6978 tweets and retweets from the conference, starting on 2017-07-15.

If you are wondering how these stats compare to other conferences, check out my [post from ICRS](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research%20rstats/2016/06/27/ICRS-tweets.html) last year.

### Who is talking

You might see twitter stats reported after conferences that look phenomenal, like 'millions saw our posts', but it is worth digging down to see how many people had substantial interaction with the conference's feed.

If we count the number of twitter users that have tweeted or RTed (re-tweet) #ICCB2017 posts, then there are 1518. Of those about 1/3 (526) have written an original tweet. If we only consider tweeters that have made >5 tweets, then we have only 118 people and organisations.

Clearly, the people talking on twitter are a biased selection of people at ICCB2017 and may also include people not there (like me). As usual, a lot people only tweet once or twice.

The users doing the most tweeting are (in order of most to least with number of tweets):

@IbuAnggrek	528, @ICCB2017	310, @AzurigenMCS	199, @WhySharksMatter	179, @rebecca_jarvis	172,
@CarlaWildlife	146, @WILDLABSNET	93, @Society4ConBio	84, @FancyScientist	80,
@davila_federico	79

### Most popular tweets

Here is a table of the most popular tweets, by their RT count:

Rank|Name|text|Retweet count
----|-------------|------|---------------
1|WhySharksMatter|Angler gives up chance at world record, releases huge blacktip shark alive. #ICCB2017 #SharkWeek (from 2014) https://t.co/dwmiAeSXQW https://t.co/74SyQ6Uhfk|96
2|eguerreroforero|@Brigittelgb en #ICCB2017: A los países megadiversos nos llaman 'megadispersos' porq no hemos logrado posicionar políticamente biodiversidad https://t.co/u43dVvcjHO|65
3|HugePossum|Australia's proposed marine parks have never been science based - bad planning for nature and people #ICCB2017 https://t.co/rZXAueuod6|64
4|ICCB2017|#ICCB2017 attendees - there are sloths in El Parque Centenario near the convention center! #UrbanWildlife https://t.co/81YktjU4Mu|59
5|Seasaver|UN Patron of Oceans calls for ban on tournaments which kill threatened sharks https://t.co/P5KmUxBte3 #ICCB2017 @TheIGFA #sportfishing|40

I like that sloths are right up there at number 4 at the moment. Marine science topics are also pretty popular. Tweets by well known people (e.g. Chief Scientist of The Nature Conservancy, Hugh Possigham) and organisations (e.g. ICCB) are more likely to become more popular. Also, those that link to topical news items (e.g. marine park policy in Australia and fishing of sharks) are also more likely to reach an audience much broader than the ICCB2017 attendees.

I like the tweet written in Spanish, which comes via a Colombian. I think it translates to (thanks google translate and a friend): "Megadiverse countries call us mega-scattered because we have failed to politically position biodiversity". [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/bluecology) if I have this wrong.  

### What people are saying

Textual analysis is a bit of a dark art, but here are some of the most popular words appearing in tweets (with the number of tweets they appear in ). Words are stemmed so or instance 'biodiverse' and 'biodiversity' both appear below as 'biodivers'

Term|Number of  tweets
----|----------------
iccb|6965
conserv|1064
amp|691
colombia|477
talk|467
biodivers|411
cartagena|380
work|362
will|323
whysharksmatter|315
societyconbio|304
open|303
great|298
can|293
come|292
use|289
conservation|287
join|285
need|248
world|244

At this stage the location is an imporant talking point with words like Colombia and Cartagena. Also predictably 'conservation' and 'biodiversity' are up there.

It is interesting that 'need' features in a lot of tweets. Perhaps many people making calls for action?

I think that words like "open", "join", "world", "come" hint at the inclusiveness of conservation conferences.

There were a few more interesting words that didn't make my list above, but have more than 100 mentions:
"[taotaotasi](https://twitter.com/taotaotasi)" - the handle of Angelo Villagomez who recieved a distinguished service award from the Society for Conservation Biology.
"shark" is the most popular plant or animal group mentioned so far, likely due to the two top 5 tweets mentioned above.
Finally the stems for happy ("happi") and peace ("peac") were also very popular.  Sounds like a fun conference.

### Time of tweets

Finally, it can be illustrative to look at the timing of tweets. This graph is made with times for the time zone local to Cartagena.
