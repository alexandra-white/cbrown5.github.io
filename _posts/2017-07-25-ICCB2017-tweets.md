## What are people saying about International Congress for Conservation Biology 2017 on Twitter?

Here's a brief analysis of tweets from the [International Congress for Conservation Biology](http://conbio.org/mini-sites/iccb-2017) to date. The conference started on the starting 23rd July I was curious to see what people are talking about there and who is doing the talking on twitter.

As of 25th July I could access 6978 tweets and retweets from the conference, starting on 2017-07-15.

If you are wondering how these stats compare to other conferences, check out my [post from ICRS](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research%20rstats/2016/06/27/ICRS-tweets.html) last year.

### Who is talking

There have been about 1500 users on #ICCB2017 so far.

Clearly, the people talking on twitter are a biased selection of people at ICCB2017 and may also include people not there (like me). As usual, a lot people only tweet once or twice.

The users doing the most tweeting are (in order of most to least with number of tweets):

@IbuAnggrek	528, @ICCB2017	310, @AzurigenMCS	199, @WhySharksMatter	179, @rebecca_jarvis	172,
@CarlaWildlife	146, @WILDLABSNET	93, @Society4ConBio	84, @FancyScientist	80,
@davila_federico	79

### Most popular tweets

Here is a table of the most popular tweets, by their RT count:

Rank|Name|text|Retweet count
----|-------------|------|---------------
screen_name|text|retweet_count
1|WhySharksMatter|Angler gives up chance at world record, releases huge blacktip shark alive. #ICCB2017 #SharkWeek (from 2014) https://t.co/dwmiAeSXQW https://t.co/74SyQ6Uhfk|96
2|eguerreroforero|@Brigittelgb en #ICCB2017: A los países megadiversos nos llaman 'megadispersos' porq no hemos logrado posicionar políticamente biodiversidad https://t.co/u43dVvcjHO|65
3|HugePossum|Australia's proposed marine parks have never been science based - bad planning for nature and people #ICCB2017 https://t.co/rZXAueuod6|64
4|ICCB2017|#ICCB2017 attendees - there are sloths in El Parque Centenario near the convention center! #UrbanWildlife https://t.co/81YktjU4Mu|59
5|Seasaver|UN Patron of Oceans calls for ban on tournaments which kill threatened sharks https://t.co/P5KmUxBte3 #ICCB2017 @TheIGFA #sportfishing|40

I like that sloths are right up there at number 4 at the moment. Marine science topics are also pretty popular.

### What people are saying

Textual analysis is a bit of a dark art, but here are some of the most popular words appearing in tweets (with the number of tweets they appear in ):

Term|Number of  tweets
----|----------------
iccb|6965
conserv|1064
amp|691
colombia|477
talk|467
biodivers|411
cartagena|380
work|362
will|323
whysharksmatter|315
societyconbio|304
open|303
great|298
can|293
come|292
use|289
conservation|287
join|285
need|248
world|244

At this stage the location is an imporant talking point. Also predictably 'conservation' and 'biodiversity' are also up there. It is interesting that 'need' features in a lot of tweets. Perhaps a lot of people saying we 'need' to do this or that?

### Time of tweets

Finally, it can be illustrative to look at the timing of tweets. This graph is made with times for the time zone local to Cartagena.
