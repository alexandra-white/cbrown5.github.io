# Current approaches to Species Distribution Modelling in R

[My course notes for "Current approaches to Species Distribution Modelling in R " for World Fisheries Congress 2021 are now free online.](https://www.seascapemodels.org/SDM-fish-course-notes/)

The course covers tidyverse and sf workflows for models, a beginners intro to modelling options and how to make spatial predictions.

There's also bonus tutorial [on the course site](https://www.seascapemodels.org/SDM-fish-course-notes/) on how to simulate data in R to test model inferences.
