### Costing the impact of cyclone Winston on Fiji's ecosystem services

Tropical cyclone Winston hit Fiji in February 2016 leaving 43 people dead, [120,000 without shelter](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-03/fijians-in-shelters-as-cyclone-winston-relief-efforts-accelerate/7217028) and [devastating infrastructure](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-07/fiji-before-after-photos-cyclone-winston/7220784)
. As Fiji recovers, Fiji's government is working to document the cost of this event to their economy.  

Our Science for Nature and People Partnership group on ['Ridge to reef fisheries'](http://snappartnership.net/groups/ridges-to-reef-fisheries/) is working with Fiji's government to help document the cost of the cyclone to the services that Fiji's ecosystems provide to people.

Assessment's of economic damage from natural disaster's typically only include direct economic costs, like the cost of repairing damaged schools. Such costings underestimate the true cost of natural disaster's to society, because they do not account for damage to ecosystems. Ecosystems provide many goods and services that are important for people's jobs and economic security.
