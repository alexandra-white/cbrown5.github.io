### Costing the impact of cyclone Winston on Fiji's ecosystem services

Tropical cyclone Winston hit Fiji in February 2016 leaving 43 people dead, [120,000 without shelter](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-03/fijians-in-shelters-as-cyclone-winston-relief-efforts-accelerate/7217028) and [devastating infrastructure](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-07/fiji-before-after-photos-cyclone-winston/7220784)
. As Fiji recovers, Fiji's government is working to document the cost of this event to their economy.

Our Science for Nature and People Partnership group on ['Ridge to reef fisheries'](http://snappartnership.net/groups/ridges-to-reef-fisheries/) is working with Fiji's government to help document the cost of the cyclone to the services that Fiji's ecosystems provide to people.

Assessments of economic damage from natural disaster's typically only include direct economic costs, like the cost of repairing damaged schools. Such costings underestimate the true cost of natural disaster's to society, because they do not account for damage to ecosystems. Ecosystems provide many goods and services that are important for people's jobs and economic security.  

For instance, coral reef ecosystems support the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people globally. In Fiji they support people through drawing tourists and providing for fisheries.

Reef ecosystems can be impacted by cyclones. The impacts can be direct, for instance the cyclone can tear up the reef, but also indirect. Heavy rainfall on land carries sediment and pollutants into rivers which then flow out to sea. The turbid waters can smother corals, killing them. Fish in turn depend on the coral habitat, so the whole ecosystem may be affected.  

The Wildlife Conservation Society is working in Fiji and has a strong partnership with government. They have been working to ensure that the assessment of the cyclones's damage includes lost ecosystem services.  

It can be challenging to mobilise  a science team to document costs after a natural disaster like a cyclone. Fortunately, our SNaPP group has already been working on documenting Fiji's ecosystem services on land and in the sea. The objective of our work is to help plan land-use change to minimise the run-off of pollutants into the ocean, where they may impact on fisheries.  

Run-off of turbid water can be worsened by land-clearing. Loss of forest destablises the soil, so more soil runs into rivers with rain. Trees also break the energy of the rainfall and absorb some of the rain, so more trees mean less of the rainfall runs into rivers.

Our team has provided the Fiji government with some basic information about catchments and forest cover on the island of Vanua Levu, one of the most affected regions (see image below).
