# Stay motivated with R programming by knowing your emotions

We don't usually think of programming as an 'emotional' experience. It is all code and computer logic and if using R, probably statistics.

We think of programmers as emotionless human-machines, who program late into the night, far removed from any subjective feelings.

But most of us aren't like this. Programming can be intensely emotional - I often confront these emotions when teaching R courses, especially when teaching newcomers.

Recognising the emotions you face when programming can actually help you be a more productive coder. Here's how.

## Emotions associated with learning to program

Some common feelings new users report are:
* Frustration
* Anger
* Intrigue
* Elation
* Bewilderment

All of these emotions, whether you see them as 'positive' or 'negative' can actually motivate or demotivate us. Let me give two examples.

**Elation** is commonly described as a 'positive' emotion, which is usually associated with cracking a difficult programming problem. For instance, maybe you just got your linear regression model to work and the results look really interesting.

Elation can motivate you to keep trying new things, because it is rewarding. It can also be demotivating. If you have prematurally declared a problem solved, the feeling of elation may mean you miss a mistake, or a better solution.

**Frustration** is probably the most common feeling I hear about (as a teacher).
Frustration can be demotivating - "I just can't fix this!". Or it can be motivating - "I need to get this fixed and I'm not getting up until I do". In fact for me, frustration is often a driving force behind solving difficult coding problems. Frustration motivates me to keep trying until its solved.



Being self aware can help you avoid defeat, stay motivated and av

## Seeing emotions as motivating

Frustration - can be stressful. See the problem as a challenge, puts it in a positive light.

## managing emotional state

When frustration becomes demotivating and overwhelming.
