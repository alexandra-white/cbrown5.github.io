## Impact of the conservation optimism hashtag

The hashtag [\#conservationoptimism](https://twitter.com/hashtag/conservationoptimism?src=hash) became popular during the recent [International Congress for Conservation Biology](http://conbio.org/mini-sites/iccb-2017) symposium.  [Michael Burgass](https://twitter.com/MJBurgass) asked me what its twitter impact was, so here is a quick analysis.

Michael also asked about \#iamaconservationist, but that has too few tweets so far to make for a meaningful analysis (about 100).

To be honest, not too much has happened on this hashtag so far, so it is hard to say too much from a broad brush quantitative analysis like this, but here are a few stats.

The first tweet I got was only on 2017-07-26 and until now there have been 813 tweets from 390 users of which 133 are original tweets and the rest RTs.

I think that spike on Wednesday corresponds to EJ Milner-Gulland's plenary at ICCB.

The distribution of tweets per user is not quite as skewed as other hashtags I have analysed. I guess becaues there are fewer users and it is the sort of hashtag that people only post once to (thought they may RT multiple others).

That's all. It might be worth doing an update on this in a few months if the tag takes off.
