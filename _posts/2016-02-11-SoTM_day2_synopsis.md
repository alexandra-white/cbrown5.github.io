### Species on the Move - Day 2 synopsis

*11 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania**

**Conservation decisions were the flavour of the second day.** We want to know when to translocate species, if we even should, where we should be putting protected areas to capture climate migrants, and how to assist climate-driven migrations.

Hugh Possingham led the keynotes, reminding us to remember the big picture - it is not just climate change we need to model/predict/adapt to, there is widespread **Change** in society, economies and the environment.

This is my take that is obviously biased towards the talks I saw. I feel your pain Gretta!

Tracy Rout's work was a great introduction to decision science for assisted colonisation of range shifting species. She showed how a [transparent decision framework (open access pub)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075814) can help us work out what we need to know if we are translocating a species. Her work highlights that decision science can be most useful when we don't know much about a system, because it helps us identify which uncertainties that matter for conservation.

Joshua Lawler showed how we can include climate change in [cost-effective priorities for reserve placement](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01847.x/full). I won't say more because I think this work is yet to be published.

Bruce Weber (CSIRO) introduced a new tool for distinguishing novel environmental ranges from contemporary, to help avoid extrapolation in models. The tool ExDent is [available here](). Weber also highlighted that the global datasets for temperature and rainfall we use for model fitting have considerable uncertainties. Be careful!

**Predicting change in whole communities was another major theme**  


**Some taxonomic gaps in understanding of range shifts were filled in**

Julian Olden is looking at range shifts in freshwater fish, an under-studied group. I won't say more because the work is cutting edge and in prep.

Species on the Move is turning the tide with WomeninSTEM success: we saw an all female panel during an organised discussion.</p>
