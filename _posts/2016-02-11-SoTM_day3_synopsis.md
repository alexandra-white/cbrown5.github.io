### Species on the Move Conference: A synopsis of day 3

*12 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania*

I am trying a new experiment today - posting the synopsis as I create it. Let me know if it works or not for you!

So this is a work in progress...

[Nathalie Pettorelli](https://twitter.com/Pettorelli) answered Possingham's challenge from [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) that we need to study and model Change, not just Climate Change.
