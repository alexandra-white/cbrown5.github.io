### Species on the Move Conference: A synopsis of day 3

*12 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania*

I am trying a new experiment today - posting the synopsis as I create it. Let me know if it works or not for you!

So this is a work in progress...

You can read the complete [day 1](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/10/SoTM_day1_synopsis.html) and [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) synopses.

[Nathalie Pettorelli](https://twitter.com/Pettorelli) answered Possingham's challenge from [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) that we need to study and model Change, not just Climate Change.

A range shift in a lobster on the south-west coast of Africa is driving an [ecosystem regime shift](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092479631400311X) on rocky reefs and impacting abalone fisheries, Laura Blamey explained. She used models to ['rewrite history' (Plaganyi day 2)](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) and found if predatory fish hadn't been overfished, [this regmie shift may not have happened](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013005401).

The impacts to fisheries are interesting to me, because years ago I naively thought (and others too) the impacts of range shifts on fisheries would not be that significant. If a species moved, fisheries should be mobile enough to follow. That is not how it is playing out. In South Africa Blamey explains, expansion of lobster is creating new opportunities for small scale fisheries but having a large economic impact on the valuable abalone fishery - a different industry that can't just switch its target species. There are winners and losers from climate change in society.
