### Species on the Move Conference: A synopsis of day 3

*12 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania*

I am trying a new experiment today - posting the synopsis as I create it. Let me know if it works or not for you!

So this is a work in progress...

You can read the complete [day 1](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/10/SoTM_day1_synopsis.html) and [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) synopses.

**Multiple stressors and climate change**

Are multi-stressors be one of today's 'themes'? Let me know what you think. 

[Nathalie Pettorelli](https://twitter.com/Pettorelli) answered Possingham's challenge from [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) that we need to study and model Change, not just Climate Change. She is using satellites to detect human impacts that may interact with climate change to drive biodiversity loss, for instance [in desert ecosystems](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rse2.5/full).

A range shift in a lobster on the south-west coast of Africa is driving an [ecosystem regime shift](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092479631400311X) on rocky reefs and impacting abalone fisheries, Laura Blamey explained. But an interaction with historical overfishing is also contributing. She used models to ['rewrite history' (Plaganyi day 2)](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) and found if predatory fish hadn't been overfished, [this regmie shift may not have happened](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013005401).

The impacts to fisheries are interesting to me, because years ago I naively thought (and others too) the impacts of range shifts on fisheries would not be that significant. If a species moved, fisheries should be mobile enough to follow. That is not how it is playing out. In South Africa Blamey explains, expansion of lobster is creating new opportunities for small scale fisheries but having a large economic impact on the valuable abalone fishery - a different industry that can't just switch its target species. There are winners and losers from climate change in society.

Tim Clark is doing exciting experimental work to look at the interactive effect of warming and fishing on coral trout mortality. I won't say more because I think it is in prep, but a hint, he has his [finger on the pulse of fish](http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/295/5/R1631.short) to learn how they respond to warming and fishing stress.  


Lucy Robinson is correcting for sampling bias in distribution modelling of toothfish and finding it makes a big difference to the predicted effect of temperature on the species.
