### Species on the Move Conference: A synopsis of day 3

*12 February 2016, Hobart Tasmania*

I am trying a new experiment today - posting the synopsis as I create it. Let me know if it works or not for you!

So this is a work in progress...

You can read the complete [day 1](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/10/SoTM_day1_synopsis.html) and [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) synopses.

**Multiple stressors and climate change**

Are multi-stressors one of today's 'themes'? Let me know what you think.

[Nathalie Pettorelli](https://twitter.com/Pettorelli) answered Possingham's challenge from [day 2](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) that we need to study and model Change, not just Climate Change. She is using satellites to detect human impacts that may interact with climate change to drive biodiversity loss, for instance [in desert ecosystems](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rse2.5/full).

Tim Clark is doing exciting experimental work to look at the interactive effect of warming and fishing on coral trout mortality. I won't say more because I think it is in prep, but a hint, he has his [finger on the pulse of fish](http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/295/5/R1631.short) to learn how they respond to warming and fishing stress.  
A range shift in a lobster on the south-west coast of Africa is driving an [ecosystem regime shift](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092479631400311X) on rocky reefs and impacting abalone fisheries, Laura Blamey explained. But an interaction with historical overfishing is also contributing. She used models to ['rewrite history' (Plaganyi day 2)](http://www.seascapemodels.org/res_posts/2016/02/11/SoTM_day2_synopsis.html) and found if predatory fish hadn't been overfished, [this regmie shift may not have happened](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013005401).

The impacts to fisheries are interesting to me, because years ago I naively thought (and others too) the impacts of range shifts on fisheries would not be that significant. If a species moved, fisheries should be mobile enough to follow. That is not how it is playing out. In South Africa Blamey explains, expansion of lobster is creating new opportunities for small scale fisheries but having a large economic impact on the valuable abalone fishery - a different industry that can't just switch its target species. The transition to a new ecosystem regime can be very painful for society, even if the end point looks ok.

**Changes in the function of ecosystems**

Blamey covered this...


At a global scale, Jorge Molinos used the velocity of climate change to predict the [future redistribution of ocean biodiversity](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2769.html?utm_source=tech.mazavr.tk&utm_medium=link&utm_compaign=article). A strength of using this simple model is that it can encompass many species, here Molinos used the [aquamaps]() data to model almost 13 000 species. Importantly, he took a current marine ecoregionalisation and looked at change in species composition in these regions. Ecoregions won't be the same in the future. He is working on regional testing of the models, for instance in the [work presented on day one by Jan Hiddink](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12726/abstract?utm_content=buffercef5a&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer). 

Ivana Matejickova from Czech Republic is finding a native freshwater fish changes to herbivory at high temperatures. Big implications here - the ecosystem function of species, which we often assume is constant, changes with warming.

Richard Hobbs - Novel ecosystems. research on climate invasions can learn much from invasion ecology. Invaders might fill a gap in an ecosystem, but they will bring new interactions with them. We don't have a manual yet for managing novel ecosystems, but the status-quo isn't an option.


**Better models?**
Lucy Robinson is correcting for sampling bias in distribution modelling of toothfish and finding it makes a big difference to the predicted effect of temperature on the species.
