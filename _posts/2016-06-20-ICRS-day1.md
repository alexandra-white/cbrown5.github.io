### International Coral Reef Symposium Day 1 - My highlights  

*20 June 2016, Honolulu Hawaii*

**Plenary**  

The theme of this conference is science to policy and the plenary speakers wasted no time in emphasising this theme to the 2500 people in attendance.  

As evidence of the importance of reef science to policy, there are three presidents from sovereign nations in attendance at the conference.   

Ruth Gates, president of the International Society for Reef Studies, wants us to tell the society how to best achieve impact to conserve coral reefs.  

Bob Richmond, the conference convener, emphasised the interdisciplinary nature of the conference, with scientists, educators and policy-makers in attendance. He said we need to move from academic outputs, like papers, towards policy impact.  To this ends, there will be special sessions on Friday to synthesise the conference's science for policy and public communication.  

A few stats >1500 oral presentations, >700 posters and 45 sessions. Ruth Gates acknowledged the 'mammoth' effort Bob Richmond and the conference organizing team had made to put this together. It's great to be here and I am certainly grateful for their efforts to bring this event together.

**Keynote from President Remengesau of Palau**  

President Remengesau said that in Palau the ocean is life and it brings us together. He wants us to realize that Palau is not a 'small island state' but a 'large ocean state'. Like many Palauans the ocean is integral to his cultural identity and livelihood. He considers himself a fisherman who has taken time off for public service. Palau has a >1000 year long history of ocean stewardship.  

Palau has established shark sanctuaries and has led the effort to establish protected areas across the Pacific. Economic incentives have been integral to ocean protection. For instance, they have implemented a green tax as part of the depature tax at airports. This helps support ocean conservation efforts. Another example comes from reef sharks, whicha are estimated to be  worth $1.9 Million over the course of their lifespan - 100s times more than their value for shark-fin soup.  

Traditional ecological knowledge is the backbone of Palau's management and governance. Palau's local scientists (sorry missed the name) emphasised the need to return to traditional governance systems, like species and temporal closures. Subsistence fishing is therefore a key part of their protected area efforts, as it ensures food-security of local people into the future.  

President Remengesau believes large marine protected areas are essential for both marine biodiversity conservation and supporting local livelihoods. Palau has declared one of the world's largest marine protected area systems. This decision is science-based.  

Sustainable development of tourism and fisheries while protecting reef biodiversity that is threatened by climate change is a key dilemma faced by many island nations. Palau is pushing back by reducing local stresses to reefs. They are also strongly engaged with global policy push for greenhouse sustainability.  

He concluded by saying we are at a cross-road for making decisions about the future health of reefs. It is essential to build trusting and long-term relationships to bridging the science to policy gap. We need 2016 to be the year of implementation for projects that can conserve reefs and dependent livelihoods.
