# Life-history traits inform time-series models and show declines in tiger sharks

[Our new research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719306020) has revealed a 71% decline in tiger sharks across Queenslandâ€™s coastline ((open-access version)[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/13/395509.full.pdf]).

In this blog I will explore the models we used to estimate this trend. (I've written about the significance of this [decline elsewhere](https://catchmenttocoast.org/2019/09/11/decline-in-tiger-shark-population-defies-expectations/).)

We aimed to achieve two things with the modelling in this paper. First, we wanted to explore how using informed priors

Second,
