# Postdoctoral job in Aquatic Ecology

We will soon advertise a 2 year postdoctoral position for an *Aquatic Ecologist* to work on environmental accounting. The work will be co-funded by a National Environmental Science Program grant on Environmental Accounting for Northern Australia and our Global Wetlands program ([some info is here, though note applications for jobs specific to the wetlands program have now closed](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2018/03/29/glow-postdoc-positions.html)).

The new recruit will lead the conceptual development of an environmental accounting approach for coastal ecosystems and the services they provide to people. The successful candidate will work with ecologists and an interdisciplinary team that includes experts in statistics, social science, economics and science communication.

Applicants should have completed a PhD or equivalent by mid-2018 and established a track record of publishing in leading ecological journals. Applicants will ideally be competent with the quantitative analysis of environmental data and conceptual synthesis of ecological data.

Interested persons can contact Chris Brown (chris.brown@griffith.edu.au) to receive further updates. We expect to post the official ad with more details in 2 weeks and will then accept full applications until early July.
