### International Coral Reef Symposium Day 3 - My highlights  

*22 June 2016, Honolulu Hawaii*

Note that I write this as speakers talk, so [let me know](https://app.griffith.edu.au/phonebook/phone-details.php?id=1675412) if you think I have missed something, see mistakes or want me to remove something.  

See also my blog on [**ICRS: Key insights**](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2016/06/21/ICRS-key-insights.html) that will be updated daily.  

## Plenary from Peter Mumby  

Increasing human stresses on reefs are decreasing variability in reef state. In the future we may see many mediocre reefs. We will increasingly have to come to terms with studying these mediocre reefs.  

The problem is that we often don't understand the subtleties in key differences in processes driving reef state. Therefore, many reefs may look the same (have similar coral cover), but the processes keeping them in that state are similar. Once they are subject to disturbance, it is difficult to predict where they will go.
