### International Coral Reef Symposium Day 2 - My highlights  

*21 June 2016, Honolulu Hawaii*

**Plenary from Charles Birkeland**  

Birkeland spoke about the success of fishery management in Palau and other Pacific Island nations.

Success comes from making decisions on a rapid time-scale. Examples of management success come from places where fishers and regulators (often the same people!) don't wait to confirm impacts, they act first, then establish impacts later.  

Birkeland said we often don't need precautionary management, we need data-less management.  

An example was night-time scuba spear fishing in Solomon Islands. Fishers came to the Governor and expressed concern that fish stocks were declining because of the spear fishing. Overnight, the Governor banned night time spear fishing.  

Rapid management decisions in Palau and other nations are in contrast to fishers managed under western laws. For instance, in Guam action to reduce overfishing was a long and slow process, because the scientists pushing for changes had to work their way through the courts and have laws changed. In the meantime several fisheries were severely overexploited.

Birkeland then explored the role of humans in coral reef food-webs.  He argued that reef food-webs have relatively low productivity compared to other ecosystems. Therefore, fishing on reefs should be subsistence only.  

He argued that coral reef food-webs are not exporting energy, they in fact use more energy than they can produce through benthic production. On reefs you often observe inverted biomass pyramids at any one instant in time. For instance, coral polyps are inverted biomass triangles - more biomass in animal cells than in algae - 5% is producers, 95% is animal.  

Therefore, reef food-webs must be importing energy and cannot sustain fishery exports.

Because reef food-webs are importing energy they cannot sustain much fishing pressure. Palau can sustainably support local subsistence fishing, which is limited. Now the problem is feeding the tourists. E.g. Palau has about ~21 000 locals vs ~161 000 tourists annually. Birkeland argued therefore that we should feed the tourists pelagic fish.  

Pelagic fish are faster growing and have higher reproductive potential at an early age than reef fish. For instance, yellow fin tuna are extremely fast growing and reach 30 pounds in their first year.

The experience in Palau was also that buying fish was also inefficient economically because they had to sell 5kg of locally caught fish to buy one small can of tuna. Therefore, the government banned export of reef fish.  

Birkeland moved on to explain how Palau is a world leader on reef management.  For instance, they were the first nation to specify their EEZ to be a shark haven (in 2009). Many other Pacific Island countries have now followed suit.

We have seen some reef fish management successes in other nations. For instance, in West Hawaii they have a very successful fishery management council that has increased the total value of fishery value 4x over the last ~20 years. The success comes from good leadership (from Bill Walsh) and that the government backed up the formation of the fishery council.

Further, the fishers avoid taking the biggest fish - they primarily want intermediate sized fish for aquariums. Bigger fish produce exponentially more eggs, so this helps keep the fishery productive.  

Birkeland said we should 'work with, not against coral reef fisheries'. Doing so requires (in a nutshell) village level management, saving the big fish, avoid exporting reef fish, keep the biggest slowest growing fish (e.g. humphead wrasse) for special events, encourage pelagic fish as food for tourists and put a cap on tourists, focus on high value tourism.  

Birkeland's talk was inspiring for its mix of lessons learned from Palau and the important role of reef ecology in understanding management success and failures. Let's hope that other nations can follow Palau's example in implementing more successful reef fishery management for the future.
