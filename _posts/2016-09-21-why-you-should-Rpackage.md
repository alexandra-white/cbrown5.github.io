### Why you should write R packages  

Creating R packages for your analysis projects is an efficient way to organise your code and data.

Sharing code is becoming the new norm in science, and it is important for repeatable science. Writing your scripts as part of an R package means you are one step closer to sharing that work with others. You can even publish and receive citations for your R packages now, to make sure you get due credit (e.g. if you are an Ecologist, check out Methods in Ecology and Evolution [Application]() section).  

Even if you don't intend to share the R package, the R package structure gives you a consistent format for storing code and data.  

Documenting your scripts is also good practice and it will help you catch up if you have to put the work aside for awhile.  The R package format provides a consistent way to document your scripts.  

I take a longer term view on projects now too, which increases the importance of creating well documented code.  I have been use R for analysis for about 8 years now. Much of my value as a collaborator to others is in my experience and knowledge about different types of analyses.

How do I draw on this knowledge? Well my wetware is fallible and I forget how I did stuff. But I do remember what projects I ran an analysis for. So I am always drawing on and updating old code for new projects. I realised recently this job would be easier if that code was better organised.

So began my journey to learn how to write R packages.
