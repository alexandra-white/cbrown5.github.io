### Coral reef science has a problem with sexism

To put it bluntly, coral reef science has a problem with sexism.  

I think gender inequity and sexism are hindering women in pursing careers in coral reef science, and this impedes advancing knowledge in the discipline as a whole.  

If you don't believe me, then ask yourself:  

* Why have there been 7 Darwin awards to men - the top international award for coral reef scientists - but none have gone to women?  
* Why are most high profile papers (e.g. Science, Nature) in coral reef sciences led by men and often have relatively few female co-authors?  
* Why are all the foundational works cited in introductions to people's talks at the symposium led by men?

I want to be clear that this article is not a criticism of any individual, or the International Reef Studies Society. In fact, note that the society's council has a reasonable gender balance and plenary talks at ICRS are balanced across genders.  

This is a criticism of all of us - including me.
