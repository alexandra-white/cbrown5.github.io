### Coral reef science has a problem with sexism

To put it bluntly, coral reef science has a problem with sexism.  

I think gender inequity and sexism are holding back women from pursing careers in coral reef science, and this impedes advancing knowledge in the discipline as a whole.  

If you don't believe me, then ask yourself:  

* Why have there been no Darwin awards to women (Darwin awards are the top international award for coral reef scientists)?  
* Why are relatively few of the high profile papers (e.g. Science, Nature) in coral reef sciences led by women?  
* Why are so few (if any) of the foundational works cited in introductions to people's talks at the coral reefs symposium led by women?  


This is a criticism generally of all coral reef scientists, including me.  

If I think about the people I know working in coral reef sciences, or the people I have seen at the recent International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS), I would estimate the gender ratio of practicising scientists to be about 50:50 (it would be great to see an actual statistic if anyone has one). Across all the sessions at ICRS probably about 50% are given by women. Participation certainly isn't as biased as in maths, physics or engineering.

One example of sexism I have heard was a a senior academic who was reflecting on the gender imbalance at a workshop. He said he would have liked to have invited more women to a workshop but there just weren't that many good female reef scientists to invite.
