Jodie joined the Australian Rivers Institute and the [Global Wetlands Project (GLOW)](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/) as a Research Fellow in 2018. She is applying her ecological and environmental management expertise to test the application of environmental economic accounting principles to wetlands and river systems at regional, national and international scales.

Jodie Haig's research interests are many and varied and include marine connectivity, invertebrate reproductive ecology, fisheries biology, marine and coastal management, stakeholder engagement and environmental policy.  

Prior to starting here, Jodie has been working as a senior scientific officer in the Queensland Government’s Office of the Great Barrier Reef; managing reef related projects, including the development of regional report cards, and providing scientific advice and guidance on strategic plans, policy and reef programs. Jodie also worked with the Qld Government’s Wetlands team to design conceptual frameworks for improved wetland management.

Prior to her job in government Jodie completed a three year post-doctoral position as a fisheries researcher at Bangor University in Wales, UK; where she managed three national projects on static gear fisheries (crab, prawn and whelk) using an ecosystem-based management approach. During this time she worked collaboratively with international research teams, fishing industry and Welsh and Manx governments to provide foundational knowledge needed to improve fisheries management.  

Jodie completed her PhD in 2010, investigating ecological and evolutionary scales of connectivity among populations of seagrass-dwelling crustaceans. She has acted in various other roles between PhD and now, including as a whale tracker, an aerial dugong monitor, a writer, a shark tagger and a television presenter.
