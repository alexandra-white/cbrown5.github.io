## Current research projects

Chris is currently working on a Discovery Early Career Research Fellowship awarded by the Australian Research Council to uncover how [habitat change is influencing the sustainability of fisheries](http://www.seascapemodels.org/fishscape/).

Chris is leading a Discovery Project (2018-2020) ["*Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems*"](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2017/11/10/interacting-impacts-grant.html). We aim to develop new models that can make predictions reliable enough to inform management of ecosystems, and that are effective when data are limited.

Chris is research lead on the nascent Global Wetlands program (2018-2022), directed by Professor Rod Connolly at Griffith University. We are part way through recruiting several postdocs to work on this program, more info on that soon.
