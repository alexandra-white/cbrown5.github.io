## My research

Dr Brown researches solutions to the environmental crisis facing ocean ecosystems. His work has had impacts at the global policy scale and local management scale. He has worked on global climate impacts to the oceans, including contributing to an IPCC Assessment Report. At a regional scale, his work has informed the monitoring of Pacific Tuna fisheries, 'catchment-to-coast' management on Pacific Islands the management of coastal habitats.

He uses advances in statistics to synthesize ecological data and inform environmental decision making. As researcher leader on the [Global Wetlands Program](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/), he brings together an international team to map the status of coastal wetland habitats and provide a blueprint for their conservation.

Chris is an enthusiastic science communicator. He also enjoys teaching statistics and modelling to applied scientists, and particularly how to access data visualisation and modelling tools using the R program. Many of his [R teaching materials are available free on this site](https://www.seascapemodels.org/code.html).

## Current research

Dr Brown will soon begin an [ARC Future Fellowship](https://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2021/08/12/future-fellowship.html) on predicting unprecedented ecological futures.

Dr Brown also is research lead on the [Global Wetlands Program](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/) a major new program of research looking at mapping the health of seagrass, mangroves and saltmarsh globally to inform on conservation actions.

Chris is leading a Discovery Project (2018-2020) ["*Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems*"](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2017/11/10/interacting-impacts-grant.html). The team aims to develop new models that can make predictions reliable enough to inform management of ecosystems, and that are effective when data are limited.
