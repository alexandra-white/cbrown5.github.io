## Current research projects

Chris is currently working on a Discovery Early Career Research Fellowship awarded by the Australian Research Council to uncover how [habitat change is influencing the sustainability of fisheries](http://www.seascapemodels.org/fishscape/).

He is research lead on the [Global Wetlands Program](https://globalwetlandsproject.org/) a major new program of research looking at mapping the health of seagrass, mangroves and saltmarsh globally to inform on conservation actions.

Chris is leading a Discovery Project (2018-2020) ["*Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems*"](http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2017/11/10/interacting-impacts-grant.html). We aim to develop new models that can make predictions reliable enough to inform management of ecosystems, and that are effective when data are limited.
