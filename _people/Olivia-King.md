# Olivia King
![](/images/people/olivia-king.jpg)

Olivia is a PhD candidate with a background in ecotoxicology, water quality, the derivation of Water Quality Guidelines for pesticides in aquatic ecosystems and environmental pollution incidents. Olivia has completed both, her Bachelor of Science (Marine and Wildlife Biology) and Honours (Ecotoxicology) degrees at Griffith University on the Gold Coast.

Olivia’s PhD research focuses on the combined and interactive effects of three water quality stressors common to the Great Barrier Reef. Specifically, Olivia aims to understand if ecotoxicological models can predict the effects of photosystem II-inhibiting herbicide exposure, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) enrichment and reduced light (due to excess suspended sediment) on marine microalgae. Olivia’s PhD is supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program Stipend Scholarship and an ARC Discovery Project grant.

Olivia is supervised by Dr Christopher Brown and Dr Jason van de Merwe.
