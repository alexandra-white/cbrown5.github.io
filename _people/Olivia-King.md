A PhD student with a background in environmental management and ecotoxicology. Olivia is working on multiple stressors of coastal ecosystems, funded by an ARC Discovery Project. She is trying to understand if simple ecotoxicological models can predict the response of coastal habitats, like corals and seagrasses, to multiple stressors.
