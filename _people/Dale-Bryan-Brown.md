A PhD candidate at the [Australian Rivers Institute](https://www.griffith.edu.au/environment-planning-architecture/australian-rivers-institute), Dale is studying role of connectivity in the conservation of marine organisms. Dale's background is in genetic methods for studying connectivity. He is now applying genetic methods to quantify connectivity in an under-studied marine habitat - mangrove forests.
