# Mischa Turschwell
![](/images/people/Mischa-Turschwell.jpg)
A postdoctoral fellow, Mischa is working on multiple stressors of coastal ecosystems, funded by an ARC Discovery Project.

Mischa finished his PhD with Griffith and CSIRO in 2017 where he used a range of modelling techniques to investigate the thermal and habitat characteristics of a threatened headwater fish species.

Highlights from his PhD research including using novel methods to quantify stream [thermal regimes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X16300292), as well as using Bayesian networks to find that riparian restoration could offset negative population consequences of [climate warming for a headwater fish](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aqc.2864).

His research interests include aquatic ecology, spatial modelling, and understanding climate-change impacts on aquatic ecosystems.
