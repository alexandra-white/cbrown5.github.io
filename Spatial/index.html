<h2> Spatial analysis in R </h2>

<p>
The R programming can work as a fully functioning GIS. It has several powerful advantages
over many other GIS programs: you can program scripts for complete automation, it is relatively fast,
and it is free.

</p>

<p>
The downside is that it is not easy to get started, particularly if you are not simultaneously
a geo-statistical expert and a gun programmer. I am trying to make the jump
 easier for ecologists by providing courses and helpful blog posts here. </p>
