<h2> R-stats Code </h2>
<p>
This is my blog for programming in R-stats (and occasionally other languages).
I am interested in mapping, GIS, simulation modelling, statistics, optimization and visualisation, mainly for
the biological sciences, but many of the applications are general. I hope you find them
useful.

If you are interested in my courses feel free to download and share them. You are welcome
to use them for your own teaching, and I would love to hear about it.
If you would like me to come and teach one of these courses at your institution, then get
in touch!

Many people don't realise that the R programming can work as a fully functioning GIS. It has several powerful advantages
over many other GIS programs: you can program scripts for complete automation, it is relatively fast,
and it is free.
<p>
The downside is that it is not easy to get started, particularly if you are not simultaneously
a geo-statistical expert and a gun programmer. I am trying to make the jump
 easier for ecologists by providing courses and helpful blog posts here. </p>
