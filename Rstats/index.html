<h2> R-stats Code </h2>

<p>
This is my blog for programming in R-stats (and occasionally other languages). 
I am interested in mapping, GIS, simulation modelling, statistics, optimization and visualisation, mainly for
the biological sciences, but many of the applications are general. I hope you find them
useful. 
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in my courses feel free to download and share them. You are welcome
to use them for your own teaching, and I would love to hear about it. 
If you would like me to come and teach one of these courses at your institution, then get
in touch!
</p>
<p> Currently I have posted courses on <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-23-R_data_wrangling_course %}"> Data Wrangling in R</a> and
<a href=""> Maps and GIS in R.</a>
