### Installing R  

If you are starting out with one of my R courses please follow these instructions to install or update R and RStudio.  You will need to be connected to the internet. I recommend updating R to the latest stable version.  

1. Install R from the [cran webpage](https://cran.r-project.org/) (downloading the appropriate file for whatever operating system you use).  

2.  If you already have R installed, this will install the latest version in a separate folder.  

3. Install or update [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). The open access (free) version is fine.  

4.  Open RStudio, click on the 'Packages' tab (should be near the bottom-left). Then click 'Install'. Install each of the below packages by typing its name then clicking the 'Install' button.  
 - dplyr  
 - tidyr  
 - ggplot2  
 - leaflet

More guidance on installing the packages can be found in my [R Conservation Programming course](/Rstats/Conservation_R_7Jun2016.html).   


 You are done! Enjoy the course.
