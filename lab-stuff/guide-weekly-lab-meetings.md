# Guide to weekly lab meetings with seascape models group

Meetings are limited to 45 minutes on days where we are doing a 'learning activity' (1-3 below), 30 minutes on days where we just have news and pub updates (1-2 below).

The standard agenda should follow:

### 1. News

This could include new papers, reviews recieved, upcoming conferences, field-work updates, interesting blogs you read, interesting research you read, cool new R tools, events at our uni etc...

### 2. Update Team Writing spreadsheet

Only for those projects that have reached an interim deadline and if Chris is around. We use a spreadsheet based on the one from [iThinkWell](http://www.ithinkwell.com.au/team-writing-tool).

In brief for each paper/project we keep track of how far complete the student believes it is, what each coauthor has to do (if anything) and an estimate of when the next update to Chris will be (e.g. new draft, or an update on whether experiments worked).  Verbal updates during the meeting should focus on how complete you estimate each project is and when you think the next interim deadline should be. Save the why (e.g. I haven't finished the draft because my experiment failed) for one-on-one meetings.

The point of this spreadsheet is to practice time management and setting personal deadlines. Also it helps Chris plan to have time to read drafts. It is NOT for micro-managing your projects.

### 3. "Learning activity"

For the last 15-30 minutes of the meeting we will work on some activity the lab is doing together. Examples include advice on time-management and writing skills. In Sept-Oct 2017 we are practicising skills for faster writing.

## Tips on facilitiating meetings

It would be great if one student each week could volunteer to run the meetings as per the agenda above. Here are a few tips on running excellent meetings.

* Keep your objectives in mind. They might be to educate others, to share news, or to learn yourself.

* Let everyone know the agenda and amount of time at the start. e.g. for these meetings let them know when we want to finish by.

* Be inclusive and try to get everyone involved.

* Be aware of who is doing the most talking and who is doing the least.

* To be inclusive, observe how others are acting in the meeting and try to guess how they might feel. For instance, if someone is not speaking up much why might that be? Are they nervous? Perhaps they disagree with what is being said? Maybe they are just bored? See if you can find a way to engage them in the meeting. For instance, by suggesting they might like to contribute by reflecting on a past experience you know they have that is relevant to the meeting. If they look bored, maybe you need to move the meeting along.

* Another tip for inclusiveness is to stop yourself when you think you have something to add (like advice on which journal to choose) and try to get the same advice out of someone else, by asking them what they think.

* Acknowledge other people's contributions.

* Keep people to time if it looks like the meeting is running over.
