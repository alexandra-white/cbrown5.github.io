<h3> Research </h3>

<p> I work on the conservation of marine ecosystems and sustainable management of <a href="/Research/index.html#fisheries_conservation">fisheries</a>.
My work brings ecological complexity to the planning tools used to inform
decision making. </p>
<div class = "image_caption">
<img src ="/Images/sweetlips.jpg" alt="fish" class="image_float"/>
<p>
Management should aim to sustain healthy ecosystems and balance conservation with human uses. Pictured are a school of sweetlips in a protected area in Raja Ampat, Indonesia. Sweetlips are also a popular food-fish.
</p>
</div>

<p>I am also interested in the impacts of <a href="/Research/index.html#climate_change_ecology">climate change</a> to
marine ecosystems.
With a team of others, we have been
synthesising the global impacts of climate change to marine ecosystems and predicting the
implications of future change.</p>

<p> If you are interested in doing a PhD on conservation, fisheries or seascape modelling, get in touch. </p>

<h3> Tools </h3>
<p> My research applies both mathematical models and statistical analysis. </p>
<p> I specialise in integrating ecologically complex models with tools for informing decision makers.
 I also work with large databases of the marine environment. </p>
<p>I use the
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R programming language</a>
and teach R to others.
My teaching resources are on this site and are <a href="/Rstats/">open-access</a>. </p>

<h3 id="fisheries_conservation"> Fisheries and conservation </h3>
<p>
The global biodiversity crisis requires new science and approaches for sustainable
management of marine ecosystems. I have studied how fishing alters food-webs, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12267/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false">
sometimes
even improving the productivity of fisheries. </a> </p>
<p>
I also study how decision makers can
meet compromises between <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12124/full">achieving productive fisheries </a>
and <a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/130296#articleToolsNext"> conserving
functioning ecosystems. </a> My recent work has focussed on the use of marine reserves
in the conservation of ecosystems and the trade-offs reserves create with fisheries.
</p>


<h3 id="climate_change_ecology"> Climate change ecology </h3>

<p>
I am interested in how climate change has affected ocean ecosystems globally. We published
a comprehensive meta-analysis of
<a href ="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n10/full/nclimate1958.html">ocean climate change studies</a>
that was subsequently used by the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/">
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> in their latest assessment report. We reviewed
studies that had at least 2 decades of observations of marine life and found widespread
impacts of climate change to marine life have already occurred. </p>
<p> I also research the ecological processes that will drive future responses of ecosystems to
climate change. These include <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v507/n7493/abs/nature12976.html">
species range-shifts </a> and the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02046.x/abstract;jsessionid=8EE8C3C39395D4D3AF3DD245C86B2DF2.f02t04?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false">
responses of food-webs to productivity change. </a>
