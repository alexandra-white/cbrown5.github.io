<div class="profile" id="tessie" >
    <h3 class="people"><a href="#tessie">Tessie Liddell </a></h3>
    <img class="profile" src ="/Images/tessie.jpeg" alt="Tessie Liddell"/>
    <p>A PhD candidate at Griffith University's College of Art, Tessie is an animation artist. She is studying how animation can be used to communicate the impacts of land-use change on riverine and marine ecosystems. She is particularly interested in turning science into a narrative that will resonate with people outside of a scientific audience. You can view some of her works <a href="https://www.theloop.com.au/oshinkooshinko/portfolio/Animator/Brisbane" target="_blank">here</a>.
