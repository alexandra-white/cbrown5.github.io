<h2>Research</h2>
<p> We work on balancing the conservation of marine ecosystems with human uses of the oceans.
   We aim to bring ecological complexity to the planning tools used to inform
decision making. </p>

<h4> Multiple stressors of marine ecosystems</h4>

</div>

<p> We are currently funded by the Australian Research Council
  (2018-2020) on a project <a href="http://www.seascapemodels.org/research/2017/11/10/interacting-impacts-grant.html)">
    Predicting interactive effects of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems</a>.
    We aim to develop new models that can make predictions reliable enough to inform management of ecosystems,
    and that are effective when data are limited. </p>
    <p> Existing approaches predict that the impacts of multiple stressors accumulate in an additive and linear way. Our proposed approach can predict that multiple
stressors interact to have non-linear effects on ecosystems.</p>

 <h4> Global wetlands project </h4>
<img class="icon-image" src="/images/GLOW-logo-wide-01.png"/>
 <p>The <a href="https://globalwetlandsproject.org/">Global Wetlands Project</a> is
 a major new program of research looking at mapping the health of seagrass, mangroves
  and saltmarsh globally to inform on conservation actions.</p>

<h4> Economic environmental accounting</h4>

<p> We are currently funded by the National Environmental Science Program
  to develop <a href="https://www.nespnorthern.edu.au/projects/nesp/environmental-economic-accounting/"
  target = "_blank">Economic-Environmental accounts</a> for Northern Australia and Coastal ecosystems </p>

    <p> Our research applies both mathematical models and statistical analysis. </p>
    <p> We specialise in integrating ecologically complex models with tools for informing decision makers.
     We also work with large databases of the marine environment. </p>
    <p>We use the
    <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R programming language</a>
    and teach R to others.
    Chris' teaching resources are on this site and are <a href="/code.html">open-access</a>. </p>
