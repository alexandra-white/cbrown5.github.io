    uses of the oceans.</h2>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <p>The future of ocean and coastal biodiversity is uncertain. This uncertainty
  threatens humanity's place on the blue planet. We urgently need to adapt
  human uses of the ocean to conserve its ecosystems and ensure it continues
  to provide us with food, energy, recreation, clean water and clean air. </p>
  <div class="main-image3">
  </div>
  <p> We are marine scientists who use quantitative tools to inform environmental
    decisions in the oceans. We do this by bringing ecological complexity to the planning tools used to
   inform decision making. We work with decision makers to provide
   quantitative advice on ocean and coastal conservation and fishery management.
   Our tools of choice are computer programming, mathematical models and statistical analysis.
    These tools allow us to work with complex datasets to find solutions for
    ocean management. </p>
   <p>We specialize in the
   <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R
     programming language</a> and teach R to others.
   Chris' teaching resources are on this site and are
    <a href="/code.html">open-access</a>. </p>

<h4> Multiple stressors of marine ecosystems</h4>
<img src="/images/dp18-image.JPG" class="icon-image">

<p> We are currently funded by the Australian Research Council
  (2018-2020) on a project  Predicting interactive effects of multiple
  stressors on marine ecosystems.
    We aim to develop new models that can make predictions reliable
     enough to inform management of ecosystems,
    and that are effective when data are limited. </p>

<p> We are helping The Nature Conservancy improve management of Pacific tuna fisheries, through
  the use of electronic monitoring systems. Our team is analysing trial monitoring data
  and demonstrating how it can be used to inform tuna management and mitigate bycatch. </p>

<h4> Fishscape: a global database of fish habitat associations </h4>
<p> 2016-2019 </p>
<p> As part of Dr Chris Brown's Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career
   Award fellowship we created a global database of fish-habitat associations</p>

<h4> Ridge to reef fisheries management </h4>
<p> 2014-2016 </p>
<p> The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
  funded us to work on
    ridge to reef fisheries management.
  We helped inform management of catchments on Pacific Islands
to improve coastal water quality, marine habitats and fisheries. </p>
<p> We were able to link deforestation to pollution and its
  impacts on coastal ecosystems. Using modelling tools, we could
  then conduct assessments of how land-use change and forest protection
  could benefit coastal fish stocks </p>.

<h4> Predicting trade-offs between marine conservation and fisheries </h4>
<p> 2012-2014 </p>
<p> Dr Chris Brown's University of Queensland post-doctoral research fellowship. We showed how
marine reserves and fisheries management can be optimized to balance trade-offs between
biodiversity and fisheries objectives. </p>
