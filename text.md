<p> I work on the conservation of marine ecosystems and sustainable management of fisheries.
My work brings ecological complexity to the planning tools used to inform
decision making. </p>


<p>I am also interested in the impacts of <a href="/Research/">climate change</a> to
marine ecosystems.
With a team of others, we have been
synthesising the global impacts of climate change to marine ecosystems and predicting the
implications of future change.</p>

<p> If you are interested in doing a PhD on conservation, fisheries or seascape modelling, get in touch. </p>


<p> My research applies both mathematical models and statistical analysis. </p>
<p> I specialise in integrating ecologically complex models with tools for informing decision makers.
 I also work with large databases of the marine environment. </p>
<p>I use the
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R programming language</a>
and teach R to others.
My teaching resources are on this site and are <a href="/Rstats/">open-access</a>. </p>
